# dns_client
DNS Client implemented in Java for making A and NS queries in UDP mode to a remote server. It was the final project for the subject "Redes de ordenadores" (computer networks) in my Bachelor's Degree "Grao en Enxeñaría en Tecnoloxías de Telecomunicación" in Universidade de Vigo in year 2018.

Main class is Dnsclient.java
The program arguments are : 
1. The transport mode (has to be udp, so type '-u') 
2. The ip address of the DNS Server.

For making a query, just type the kind of query (A or NS) and the name. For example: 
'A www.google.es'

The 'pablo' package has been developed by Pablo Sanuy.
The other package was given by the teachers.
